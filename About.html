<p>Hello, this is currently an independent project created by a swedish archaeology master student with the help of Gunma museum. In order to continue this project we would need to keep seeking out information and images of Haniwa. 
The purpose of this project is to give researchers and the public an easier access into Haniwa for further comperative studies. With this database we could cros-refernece the archives of different museums to find patterns in Haniwa and deepen our understanding of them. 
By providing this website in both english and japanese we are able to provide this information to a bigger audience. I hope it will also deepen the interest in this fantastic cultural heritage and bring more interest to smaller museums </p>
